# UI5-WebStorm-Files - Now 1.30.9 compatible!

The files needed for this guide - http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end/blog/2014/09/22/configuring-jetbrains-webstorm-for-ui5-development.

I will keep up to date as new versions of UI5 are released. I'll also be adding more tools and things as and when I discover them.
